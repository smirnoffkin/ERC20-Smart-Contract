# My CryptoCurrency on Ethereum

This is my test ERC20 Standard Token  
I am using the Ropsten Network - the official test network of the Ethereum blockchain  
The adress of my smart contract is 0xc602624A2012397adB47f336ABe6d7A8E5f6f1a0  
Also use [Etherscan](https://ropsten.etherscan.io) as blockchain explorer  
If you want to get ETH in Ropsten Network use [Ropsten faucet](https://faucet.egorfine.com)
